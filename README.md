# WordPress Blueprints

A collection of Blueprint JSON files for loading WordPress sites in WordPress Playground.

These blueprints serve as templates for creating new WordPress environments in the playground, allowing users to easily load and configure various WordPress setups. Each blueprint defines a specific set of configurations, plugins, and themes that can be used to create a consistent environment for testing and development purposes.

Blueprints can be used to:

- Create test environments with specific versions of WordPress
- Configure different plugin and theme combinations
- Standardize development environments across multiple users

To use these blueprints in WordPress Playground, get the raw url of any blueprint and pass it as a query parameter called `blueprint-url` to https://playground/wordpress.net/
